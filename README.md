# Airline Optimization Project

## Overview

Welcome to our Airline Optimization Project! Our company has been a trusted provider of high-quality air transportation services for several years. However, we are currently facing challenges that impact our profitability, including stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market.

In response to these challenges, we are launching an analysis of our database to identify opportunities for improving our occupancy rates. The goal is to enhance the average profit earned per seat, ultimately strengthening our financial position in a competitive market.

## Key Obstacles

### 1. Stricter Environmental Regulations

The airline industry is under growing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Stringent environmental laws have been implemented, resulting in higher operating costs and limitations on expansion opportunities. Our team is dedicated to finding innovative solutions to navigate and comply with these regulations.

### 2. Higher Flight Taxes

Governments worldwide are imposing heavier taxes on aircraft to address environmental concerns and generate revenue. The increased flight taxes have raised the overall cost of flying, leading to a reduction in demand. We aim to identify strategies to mitigate the impact of higher flight taxes on our business and maintain competitive pricing.

### 3. Tight Labor Market

The aviation sector is currently facing a scarcity of skilled workers, resulting in higher labor costs and increased turnover rates. We recognize the importance of our workforce and are committed to finding ways to attract and retain talent while optimizing operational efficiency.

## Project Objectives

Our primary focus is to analyze our database and uncover opportunities to increase the occupancy rate, thus maximizing the average profit earned per seat. Through this optimization project, we aim to address the key obstacles outlined above and position our company for sustainable growth.
